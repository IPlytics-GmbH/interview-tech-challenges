# IPlytics Frontend Challenge
​
Thank you for your interest in becoming part of the IPlytics team.
​
We are curious about you, your special talents, we want to know how you approach
and solve problems.
​
Therefore we kindly ask you to show us your approach to solve our little
challenge:

We ask you to implement the following weather statistics UI.
​
## Requirements
* It should be possible to see 2 charts:
  - A D3 bar chart showing the average temperature across the 12 months
  - A D3 line chart showing the change of temperature in a single month
* It should be possible select the month shown on the line chart by clicking the corresponding bar in the bar chart
​
### Further information and constraints:
* The line chart should have circles to on the line to indicate each day of the month
  - A nice to have (not required) is to show the value of the temperature on hover  of the circle
* The values are randomly generated
* The charts should have appropriate titles
​
### Testing
You don't have to write tests for the complete application but we ask you to
write one test, that tests some logic of the application and one test that
tests an actual component.
​
### Styling
The project does not have to be styled. But make sure the UI is understandable and usable!
​
## Tech Stack:
* Please use ReactJs for the frontend and D3.js to create the charts
​
## What we are looking for:
* consistent commit history
* clean and well readable code
* iterative approach (we need to able to read through your commit history and see how you iterated on your logic / ui / implementation)
* Well documented readme.md including steps to run your app locally on our side.
​
## Misc
If you want to show your special talent, you are free to have some extra fun in
an area of choice. It is absolutely fine, to stick
to the requirements but maybe you want to show us where you shine the most.
